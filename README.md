Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Team Smart Riders from Germany, participating in the WRO World Finals 2023. This repository contains all the code, documentation, and resources for our project, SmartiecarV2. We have used scoring criteria from the ruleblock as headings in our documentation to make it easy to navigate our repository.

For the wold final we decided to redesign our future engineers car.
Now our car consists of an arduino which controls the sensors and the motors and a raspbarry pi which does all the image prossesing in the obstacle race.


<a name="Design-Process"></a>


### Design Process

For the World Final, we ran a throurogh analysis of our German Final car version to identify, what worked well and what did not works so well.
From that, we compiled a list what to keep and what we want to improve..

Results of analysis:
ok:
- arduino work with ultrasonic and gyro
- rgb lcd display for feedback
- gyro sensor precision

inprove:
- image processing unstable
- curve detection in obsticle race
- precision
- stopping in the start area
- hardware repairs too time consuming due to complex chassis
- car track width to large (17cm)
- driving low speed
- breaking distance to long

  For the WRO Final car, we designed 3 modular layers to seperate funktions from each other and make it much easier to repair.
  We adress the detailed solutions we found to the identified issues in detail in the following chapters.

### Chassis

We used the Totemmaker construction system to design and build our own car chassis. This set consits of plastic beams and plates as structural
elements and aluminium connectors. For specific parts as the front of the wheel barrel and the motor bracket, totemmaker.net offers a free STL-Libary of 3D-printable parts.
To get a small but strong structure, we used rectangular grids as the basic element of each layer. The first layer had to be as thin as possible but still had to contain the motor, the axles and the servo. We did not have much room to work with. Thats why we did not use a baseplate. A baseplate would have been to large for our car. We just build a stable rectangular frame, two beams wide, and mounted the front and back axle to it. After that we rounded up the edges of the layer because it does not have much space between it and the game field and our field was a bit wavy.
Because the last car was difficult to repair we wanted to construct the next version of our car with that in mind. We now have a modular system with three individual layers. The top two have the same base of contruction. For both layers we started with a stable rectangular frame of four plastic beams. These beams make the layers stable and strong but not to heavy at the same time. We wanted the layers to be easily connected to each other with screws. The third layer just has two extra beams for the ultrasonic sensors. Because the third layer is the "sensors and control" layer, we wanted to mount the ultrasonic sensors to it. But it was to high. That is why we used the beams to lower them closer to the ground.

Layer 2:

Layer 3:

Tires:

In our building process we tested different tires from different manufacturers. We tested the tires that were included in the Totemmaker contruction
system, standard racing tires we bought from Funduino and onother set of tires with no tread pattern.
During the initial test drives, we noticed that the tires we took from the Totem Maker construction system were too large and were rubbing against the frame. The second set of tires from Funduino were smaller and harder, but they often caused oversteering when the car was turning sharply. Now, for the final setup, we are using softer tires without any tread pattern, which maximizes ground contact.

<a name="assembly-instructions"></a>


### Assembly Instructions üõ†

In order to build our car you have to build the different layers seperately and connect the later. 
First start with the first layer. Cut the beams and connectors to size and connect them like shown here:

![Layer 1 SIde](https://github.com/Nezar187/GSG_SmartiecarV2/assets/131177565/01643d91-ad0c-45a6-9f48-54e8f5fc4d56)

Link Totemmaker Build Instructions
After you built the frame you can build and attach the front axle. You will need the 3D printed parts from Totemmake.net. For the back axle we used parts from the Make-Block construction set, which we cut to size as well. Additionally you have to use another 3D printed part from Totemmaker.net to screw the motor in place. Because the frame is very thinn you will have to connect the motor with the back axle via a set of bevel gears. Next you build the second layer like shown in the schematics. You will have to cut the parts again:

![Layer 2 ](https://github.com/Nezar187/GSG_SmartiecarV2/assets/131177565/74bc6621-d1cb-463a-be06-c65dcb2172c3)

Next you have to again cut the beams and assemble them according to the schematics to build the third layer:

Next you will have to put all of the other electronic components on the layers. The sensors and the controllers on the third layer. The power management on the second and the motor with the servo on the first.

### Driving Motor and Gearing

We tested two different motors. One which operates on 6V and another which does on 12V. In our last version of our car we used a 12V motor. We wanted to use the 6V motor so that we do not have so many different voltages in our car. In our testing the 6V motor broke quite often. The 12V motor was more reliable. That is why we decided to use the 12V motor instead of the 6V. After we had decided what motor to use we had to decide how to screw it to the frame. In our first version of our car the axis of the motor was parallel to the back axle. Because of the limited space we had we had to turn the motor so taht its axis pointed to the back axle. We connected the motor and the back axle with bevel gears for a 1:1 ratio.

<img src="https://github.com/Nezar187/GSG_SmartiecarV2/assets/131177565/f8b99575-93f0-4b29-bc44-e6aac457f7e1" width="50%">

In our previous car version, we used a L298D motor driver. We had several issues with motor control. 
With this driver, the minimum PWM speed control value to make the car start running was rather high, so we could not drive slow enough for a good control.
As a result, the braking distance was also rather long, almost 30cm. Additionally, the L298D dissipates 1.4V as heat during operation.
To solve these issues, we experimented with other motor drivers and finally decided to use the Cytron MD13S motor driver instead.
With this motor driver, the motor starts running at much lower PWM settings and therefore allows us to drive much slower. 
The braking distance is down to a few centimeters now. As it uses a different type (MOSFET) transistors, heat is much lower. 
And it has a nice cable plugin socket, which was very convenient for our hardware layers concept.
It also comes with a very good Arduino library by the manufacturer, which made it easy to use in the arduino software.

<a name="Steering-Mechanism"></a>


### Steering Mechanism

We used the ackermann steering geometry for our steering mechanism. The idea behind the ackerman steering is that the inner wheel turs a bigger angle than the one on the
outside. In order for it to turn around the middle axis of the axle. We use a metal gear servo (Tower Pro MG995) because our car is very heavy. The axis of the servo is in the middle of the front axle. It is directly connected to the steering rod, because the power of the servo transfers better to the steering rod with a direct connection. Another reason for us to build a direct connection is that the first layer of our car is very thin and there is not much space to build any other connetion from the servo to the steering rod. 

We used a steering trapeze to calculate where to put the back axle of our car and the length of our steering rod. We drew it on a piece of paper and later transfered it to the computer.

Steering Trapeze:

<img src="https://github.com/Nezar187/GSG_SmartiecarV2/assets/131177565/d627f769-6dab-4882-8252-478ff478e4c7" width="50%">

Because of the layers in our car, the servo motor for the steering had to be mounted on the first (lowest) layer. Because of that it was difficult to connect the servo with the steering mechanism. The plastic beams from the layer around the servo limited its range of motion. That is why we had to extend the steering rod to succesfully connect the servo to the steering mechanism. The servo is now directly connected to the steering mechanism via the steering shaft.

### Power and Sense Management
<img src="https://github.com/Nezar187/GSG_SmartiecarV2/assets/131591590/35a215e8-1b19-4504-bd92-aa972cfa088c" width="75%">


Our car has a special level called "Power and Sense Management" level.
On this level, there are important parts that affect the car¬¥s performance and control.
At the center of Power and Sense Management is a step-up converter that is specifically responsible for the motor.
On the right side of this level we find the on/off switch.
There are two step-down converters on both the left and right sides of the vehicle. In addition to these components
and the motor driver is also housed on this level. 


<a name="Power-supply"></a>


### Power supply
<img src="https://github.com/Nezar187/GSG_SmartiecarV2/assets/131591590/7235a714-503e-4248-bcb2-d01d52edebd4" width="75%">





We use 7.4 V-Lithium-polymer battery as our central power supply it is locatet in the space between layers one and two.
In our previous car version, we used a 11.1 V Lipo. AS this one is very heavy, we decided to exchange it for a less heavy 7.4 V Lipo 
of the same capacity.
 we use a 3000 mAh lipo,as the Raspberry Pi is very Power-hungry when doeing image processing. 
The on/off switch is connectetet directly to the output of the Lipo Behind the switch,we disstribute the power to 2 step-down and one step-up converters .

The step-up converter produces 12V for our motor driver. 
The two step-downs both produce 5V,one is used for the controllers ( Raspberry  Pi and Arduino ), the other for the steering servo and lights.
 See circuit diagram for details on connections.
 
  





<a name="Controllers"></a>


### Controllers
In our previous car version, we used an Arduino Nano as a controller and a Smart Camera Module for the image processing. 
Due to the problems with the smart camera solution, we wanted to replace it with a raspberry pi and our own image processing.
We considered moving all functionality over to raspberry pi but decided against it. The arduino with its sensors worked quite well.
We were afraid to hit hardware and compatibility problems we could not solve fast enough when running all on the raspberry pi.
Due to having two controllers, we needed to let them communicate with each other. The communication runs over serial interface.
We tried to establish the serial communcation via the RX/TX Pins of the raspberry pi and the arduino. 
As the raspberry pi runs on 3.3V and the arduino on 5V, we needed a level shifter in between. But this solution did not work, the connection failed.
Therefore, we got back to the easy way: the arduino is plugged into one of the USB ports of the raspberry pi.
The problem we had to solve with this setup is, that on Power-on, the raspberry pi always resets the arduino when it opens the serial connection.
We solved that with a software handshake between arduino and raspberry pi during startup.
The arduino is responsible to control all motors and sensors, the raspberry pi has a camera attached to it and does the image processing.


<a name="Sensors"></a>


### Sensors

Our car is equipped with a total of four sensors.
Three of them are ultrasonic sensors, which allow for the detection of nearby obstacles.
In addition our vehicle has a gyro sensor, which is located in the Third level of the car.
Our gyro sensor helps measure rotational movements, providing more precise control.


![Foto 01 10 23, 13 21 16](https://github.com/Nezar187/GSG_SmartiecarV2/assets/131591590/3d9320cd-b7b1-484e-a440-67566e307d7c)

In the front sensor grid, we have three ultrasonic sensors to measure distances to the left, the front and the right. 
The ultrasonics are all mounted in the front part, as we use them to detect the curves. In the opening race, some of the streets can be narrow. To run a good curve,
the car must sense the opening of the curve as soon as possible.
We chose the DFRobot ultrasonic boards as they can be mounted easily on our chassis. Additionally, they have plastic covers to avoid damage when the robot runs into something.
To run rather reliable turns and to go straight no matter which starting place, we use a Bosch BNO055 IMU sensor. 
This sensor has a gyroscope, an accelerometer and a compass onboard. What we need from the sensor is the orientation angle on the field. In theory, a gyroscope only would do that.
However, gyroscopes tend to drift, when mounted on moving vehicles. The BNO055 has an onboard processor to calculate reliable angles by combining measurements from all its sensors.
As the compass is unreliable indoors, we switch it off and run on gyroscope and accelerometer data only.

<a name="camera"></a>


### camera

One of the problems withour previous smart cam was the angle of view. We wanted to use a wide angle camera.
For raspberry pi 4, there are different options. The native raspberry pi v3 wide angle camera is not yet compatible with the opencv image processing package, so we could not use it.
We tested the Waveshare wide angle camera and skipped it, because the color saturation of the image was poor. In some light conditions, it was hard to distinguish green pillars and the walls.
The best fit was the raspberry pi HQ camera with M12 mount and a Arducam wide angle lens. The driver allows to set color saturation and brightness so we get a bright image with clear colors.
The disadvantage of this camera is, that it is rather big and heavy compared with the others.

### Failsafe Mechanisms
We inculded different failsafe mechanisms to avoid mistakes.

Hardware failsafe:

Colorcoding the wires:
We used different colored tape to mmark wires which belong to the same component or mechanism. It reduces the amount of mistakes we make while wiriring the car back up. 
In our first competion one of the wires of our car became unplugged and it took us a while to locate where it had been before. Now we know where the wires belong and where to put them incase of an emergency.

![arduino_wiring](https://github.com/Nezar187/GSG_SmartiecarV2/assets/131177565/df454e80-426f-4515-aae1-7075e8a02669)


Software failsafe:

Colorcoding the LCD:
Like in our previous car we use LCD screen to give us feedback from our programm. The only difference is that we now use an arduino and a rasperry pi. That is why we use 2 LCD screens istead of one. We differenciate between colorcodes for the opening race and for the obstacle race. 

Opening race (rasperry pi not in use):
- red = starting sequence
- yellow = ready to start -> wating for button (shwoing sensors)
- green = driving
- blue = curve

obstacle race (rasperry pi):
- red = autostart 
- then showing what it sees through the camera
- white = no pillar
- red = red pillar
- green = green pillar

obstacele race (arduino):
- red = starting sequence
- yellow = ready -> waiting for button 
- then showing what pillar color it is working on
- white = no pillar
- red = working on red pillar
- green = working on green pillar
- blue = curve
- purple = turn
