construct

Firstly we dicided that we wouldn´t be using our car which we used in the national championship.
The old car had a some flaws which we wanted to get rid of.
- the car was to wide (17 cm). It was difficult to steer between the pillars.
- the camera wasn´t the best. It didn´t always detect the blocks right and couldn´t work with distractions in the background.
- 
We came to the conclusion that
it would be easier to just build a new car than to make the old one better. 
We stayed with the Totem-Maker-Set. Thats why our car mainly constist aout of parts from Totem-Maker.
We didnt use istructions for the car. A few parts from the front axis are 3d printed and come from the Totem-Maker stl libary.
The servo broke ones in our last car. It took very long to replace it. Overall it was difficult do replace broken parts.
Thats why we implemented a modular System to our new car.

We currently have 3 Layers: 
The first layer constist of the wheels with the motor and the servo.
The second layer houses the power management.
On the third layer we mounted the arduino and the rasperry pie.

Picture Layer seperate

We firts build an stable frame for the driving module. We started with the motor and the wheels.
We mounted everything on the frame and cut an hole in the top to fit the servo.

Picture old frame

At first we wanted to mount the servo onto the second module. But then we wouldent be able to take the modules
apart easiely.
