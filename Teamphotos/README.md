# Team description

Our team consists of three guys: Noah, Nezar and Lucius.
Together we proudly represent the GSG Lünen and have given ourselves the team name “Smart Riders”. 
We are all in 11th grade and this is our first time participating in the WRO. Our first robot project was participating in the FLL.
